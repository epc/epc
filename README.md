Consulting CTO focused on pragmatic, immediate solutions to complex technology problems.

In a past life I was IBM’s “Corporate Webmaster”.
It was 33% HTML jockey, 47% complex systems administration, 49% product and project management where the responsibilities were anything the Corporation decided were my responsibilities that moment, and 66.7% anything else people could come up with.
I was simultaneously considered to be the worst possible person to be running IBM’s web infrastructure and yet also completely irreplaceable and required to be involved in anything IBM corporate did on the web.
In retrospect the role kind of sucked.

I left IBM when the company decided to “pivot” away from a trillion dollar marketplace and focus on more important things.

I am not looking for a job.
I used to offer consulting services but made the classic consulting mistake of believing companies wanted to have their problems solved quickly and efficiently.
