# Consulting CTO:
What do I mean by _Consulting CTO_?  I am someone who you brief on your company and its current problems and opportunities, who can help you hire a CTO, who can help your existing CTO work through problems, who can be a reserve set of skills to help you and your organization through critical phases, without the overhead of being full–time headcount.  

I do not want to be your CTO. I do not want to replace your CTO. I want to help you avoid the thousand mistakes made every year by novice CTOs as they navigate growing your business.
