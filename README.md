Retired CTO.

In a past life I was IBM’s “Corporate Webmaster”.

It was approximately 33% HTML jockey, 33% complex systems administration, 33% complex network administration, 47% product and project management, 25% cross–matrix corporate ego management and 35% insane, 90 day death march orchestration and resolution.

I was simultaneously considered to be the worst possible person to be running IBM’s web infrastructure and yet also completely irreplaceable and required to be involved in anything IBM corporate did on the web.

On reflection, the role kind of sucked.

I left IBM when the business decided to “pivot” away from the “Internet” market and focus on more important things.

I am retired.

I am not hiring.

I am not buying.

I am not investing.

I am not networking.

I am not selling anything.

I am not looking for a job.

If you see me active on here it’s because I am tinkering, nothing more.
