# Consulting CTO:
What do I mean by _Consulting CTO_?  I am someone who you brief on your company and its current problems and opportunities, who can help you hire a CTO, who can help your existing CTO work through problems, who can be a reserve set of skills to help you and your organization through critical phases, without the overhead of being full–time headcount.  

I do not want to be your CTO. I do not want to replace your CTO.  I want to help you avoid the ten thousand easy mistakes made every year by novice CTOs as they navigate the mess they’ve gotten into.

# Currently working on:
* [Riskigy](https://riskigy.com/): helping former ibm.com colleague Mike Marrano set up a vCISO/vCTO service in the New York City metropolitan area focused on small–medium financial firms.
* [Factotum](https://factotum.travel): Trying to answer the question of what if you mixed Tripit with some machine learning.  Suspended for a bit as Covid–19 shakes its way through the world.
* [Stigmergy](https://stigmergy.com/): On again/off again business focused on mining data for small businesses.

I have a really annoying hobby in small–scale robotics that I hesitate to say I’m working on until the thing I’m working on does something more than spark and smoke.

## Conflicts of interest:
* I cannot work on any engagements involving IBM, MongoDB Inc (f/k/a 10Gen), Google, or The New York Times.

# Available for Consulting CTO work in the NYC metropolitan area:
* help plan, review and manage development of MVPs for companies without a CTO,
* advise new CTOs on problem solving strategies and approaches, regardless of problem domain,
* resolve specific, time / domain bounded problems.

I do not offer software development services. There are a million outsourcing services which will happily low–ball a quote for you. It is not worth my time to try competing with them.  That does not mean I do not write code, nor that I will not write code to solve your problems, but if you’re looking for a software developer you will be happier with someone else.

**Rates:** US$325 / hour. A limited number of hours per month can be reserved on a retainer basis.

For problem analysis & resolution: a percentage of the cost of the problem.

I only sign NDAs when 50% of the projected project cost has been pre–paid.
