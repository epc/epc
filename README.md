Consulting CTO focused on pragmatic, immediate solutions to complex technology problems.

Not hiring, not purchasing services, nor placing investments at this time.

In a past life I was IBM’s “Corporate Webmaster”. I’ve given up trying to explain the role.
It was 50% hands on technical, 50% product/project/personnel management, 50% cross–corporate matrixed organization management, and 97.7% primary help desk for all things Internet for 400,000 IBM employees.
I'm aware that those numbers add up to more than 100%.
This is why I was replaced by a new IBM division in 1998, Enterprise Web Management.

I am available on a retainer basis to advise CEOs, CTOs on technology operations, problem analysis and resolution.
I would be best utilized to help your team work through design decisions or resolve application performance problems.
